Ever since I was a young boy I had loved the smell of coffee. 
I would get up as early as I needed to every morning just so I could be sure I would be awake to smell the fresh pot my mother brewed. 
I loved everything about coffee, the scent, the warmth, the comfort of the routine. 
It was all these things that made it clear to me that I must open a cofee shop. 
There was nothign else that made sense, it was my pashion, my dream, my calling. 
But I soon learned that it was not as easy as I thought, and my biggest problem was finding a place for my shop, no simple store would do. 
Becasue it was my love, my passion it had to be perfect and perfection is not easy to find.
